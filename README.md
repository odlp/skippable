# Skippable

Skippable helps you skip slow commands unless certain files changed. This can be
handy on CI, where valuable time, money, and COâ‚‚ are often wasted by repeatedly
running the same command when nothing changed.

For example [License Finder](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder) takes ~45
seconds to run on a project with Ruby gems and NPM dependencies. In this example
there's no need to check the licenses if the dependency lockfiles didn't change.

## Usage

Add Skippable to your Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem "skippable", require: false
end
```

Setup a `.skippable.yml` config file with one or more tasks:

```yaml
tasks:
  expensive_op:
    command: bundle exec my_slow_command
    paths:
      - lockfile_a
      - lockfile_b
```

Run the task using `skippable`:

```
bundle exec skippable expensive_op
```

- If the cache was cold OR the lockfiles changed, the specified command will
be run
- If the cache is warm, and the lockfiles haven't changed, the command
will be skipped

Finally, cache the following directory to persist state across builds:

```
tmp/skippable
```

## Example

```yaml
# .skippable.yml
tasks:
  license_finder:
    command: bundle exec license_finder
    paths:
      - Gemfile.lock
      - yarn.lock
```

Invocation:

```
bundle exec skippable license_finder
```
